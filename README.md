RAP example
===========

This is a copy of the Mail application example provided with Eclipse RAP. However, in this version I
create a standalone non-OSGI app instead of a workbench based one.

Other than that I modified the application so that it can easily be launched on Heroku or Tomcat 7 (that is what Heroku
uses).

The tutorial describing what has been done is at http://edmundo.lopezbobeda.net/blog/how-deploy-your-eclipse-rap-application-heroku .
